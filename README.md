# HelloApp

### My First Python Gui App. I have been learning a lot of Programming at School and i wanted a way to show all of this awesomeness to my friends without having them compile code or share .py files. So i googled and am currently learning Kivy. Hope to bring live to my codes with Graphical User Interfaces


# How to Run

You Must have Kivy fully Installed
